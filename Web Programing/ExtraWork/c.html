    <p>C is considered mother of all programming languages as many later languages like Java, PHP and JavaScript have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C.
If a person learns C programming first, it helps to learn any modern programming language as it provide a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of programming and underlying architecture of the operating system like pointers, working with memory locations etc.
C is widely used in operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, databases, networking, game engines, and real-time systems for its efficiency to work in low resource environment and hardware-level support.</p>
